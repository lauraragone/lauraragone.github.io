							OnTrac is a suite of native apps designed to optimize transit data for wearable tech. Using the rich-featured, RESTful OnTrac API to retrieve General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data for MTA NYCT, the Pebble watch app and companion iOS app relay relevant real-time and scheduled train arrival information via location services and geo-fencing. An Apple Watch app is currently in development, and an Android Wear app is planned for the future.
						</p>
						
						<p class="text">
							The stand-alone Pebble app competed in <a href="http://2014mtaappquest.challengepost.com/submissions">the MTA App Quest 3.0</a> competition hosted by ChallengePost. From early on, it attracted the attention of <a href="http://nypost.com/2015/02/12/mta-hosts-best-transit-apps-contest/">the NY Post</a>.
						</p>
						
						<p> 
							OnTrac is designed with native New Yorkers in mind. The iOS app features stylized, custom Map Views and train times at a glance, allowing users to make informed decisions regarding their transportation options.

							The watch face is designed to appropriately match any of the 256 color possibilities for each of the three tiers of light present on the Empire State Building to its closest equivalent available to the limited Pebble color palette.

							The Flappy Bird rip-off that creeps on your location.
						</p>
						<p class="text">
							To be fair, it's considerably less sketchy than that. Although many critical gameplay elements and assets for Weather Bird are in the style of the viral hit <a href="https://twitter.com/dongatory">from this guy</a>, Weather Bird was created to serve a distinct, novel purpose. Primarily, Weather Bird serves both as a case study in game design and proof of concept for <a href="paradox.html">a different game</a> currently in development, while also presenting a valuable opportunity to become familiar with both Swift and SpriteKit.
						</p>
						<p>
							Now, what <i>is</i> it?
						</p>
						<p>
							Weather Bird is a side scroller for iOS that incorporates real world weather, time of day, and seasonal changes into gameplay. Ambiant elements, from cloud coverage to percipitation, are pulled from the current climatic conditions of the user. The position of the sun is also considered - starting a game during the day yields different initial conditions than starting a game during the night. Furthermore, the time of day in-game progresses at a rate proportional to the amount of sunlight characteristic of the player's location given the current season. The combination of these ambiant elements promote immersion and illustrate progress in an otherwise <span title="Yet, addictive">static</span> gaming experience.
						</p>
						<p>
						</p>
					</summary>
					<p>
						Weather Bird is build using Sprite Kit, CocoaPods, and AFNetworking. It embraces the iOS8 aesthetic with dynamic blur effects and parallax. It syncs with iCloud, incorporates Game Center, and caches seasonal inforamtion in a subtle, yet useful way. High scores are <i>slighty</i> more difficult to manipulate than the real Flappy Bird.
					</p>
					<p>
						A full write-up, complete with gameplay gifs, will be made available soon.

						<p>
							 A fast-paced, real-time puzzle/concentration game developed for iOS using Cocos2d.
						</p>
						<p>
							Stop zombies from taking over a 2-D matrix! Find and tap the zombies in order to stop them from infecting the bits that populate the screen. Bits, you say? How can one tell whether a simple 0 or 1 is a zombie? Therein lies the challenge, my friend. Spot the sluggish (i.e. undead) bits from amongst the rapidly changing values sliding across the stage to save the binary world from the apocalypse.
						</p>
						<p>
							Both casual gamers and puzzle game enthusiasts alike will appreciate the rapid, immersive, concentration-intensive gameplay provided by bitBytes. Have an iOS device? Hunt down zombies while commuting to class or while waiting for that commercial break to end - level designs promote brief, frantic, and frequent gameplay sessions. Like zombie-culture? Think binary looks cool? bitBytes is the game for you!
						</p>
					</summary>
					<p>
						<img class="img-responsive" src="images/scene_flow.png" alt="Scene transition flowchart for bitBytes." width="360px" align="right"/>
						bitBytes was originally targeted for deployment on iOS 4.3.
					</p>
					<p>
						The complete game includes 16 distinct levels with scaled difficulty, high score and star-ranking system, records view, user-friendly level selection, gameplay instructions, mutable volume, pause/restart functionality, and Game Center integration.
					</p>
					<p>
						Level selection involves dynamically parsing XML using GDataXML (&copy Google). Sprites created via plist.

						Screenshots will be made available soon.

							The ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest is an annual multi-tiered competitive programming competition that pits university students from across six continents against the clock in pursuit of solutions to critical thinking problems. Following contest conclusion, ACM-ICPC questions are hosted online and made accessible via <a href="http://acm.hust.edu.cn/vjudge/toIndex.action">Virtual Judge</a> for the masses to attempt.  Successful implementations require familiarity with:

								<li>computational geometry</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<p>
							 All programs must take their input from standard input, and must write their output to standard output. Test cases require handling large data sets, and both runtime and memory usage must meet strict requirements. Approximately <span style="color: #cc9966"><i>a hundred</i></span> solutions satisfying ACM-ICPC criteria will be available on my Github once I upload them.

						<p>
							Carto is an autonomous 3D mapping system intended to aid interior designers in generating 2D floor plans from existing structures. The robotic system is intended to traverse an interior space and output a dimensioned floor plan without any exclusions of area. The project's primary task was the development of software modules and hardware modifications required to make an existing robot fully autonomous. Operational obstacles involved circumventing obstructions, optimizing autonomously selected scan locations, and compensating for scanner blind spots.

						</p>
						<!--<p>
							<i>PIC-a-Color ChameLeon</i>, or Leon for short, is a mechatronic platform intended for educational purposes in a high school setting.
						</p>-->
						<p>
							Leon imitates a chameleon in nature by changing his color to match his surroundings and to fool predators. Leon has two DC motors that allow him to move around, in addition to a color sensor and LEDs that allow him to sense and display colors. His phototransistor and push buttons enable him to sense imminent danger. His body is 3D printed out of ABS plastic, and is mounted on a basic chassis. Leon is programmed and controlled via an Arduino Uno.
						</p>
						<!--<p>
							Leon integrates the principles of biology and engineering sciences by replicating the ability of a chameleon to alter its skin color. The intention is for high school students to be more engaged in the learning process by interacting directly with mechatronic devices that teach them scientific principles.
