				Hey, there!
			</h1>
			<p>
				I'm Laura, an aspiring Software Engineer from Brooklyn, NY.
			</p>
			<p class="text">
				I'm a lifelong New Yorker with a passion for NYC. In my free time, I enjoy skygazing, archery, photomanipulation, and <a href="doodles.html">etching</a>. I'm also currently developing <a href="../projects/paradox.html">a multiplayer, side-scrolling beat 'em up</a> game for iOS and training to run my first marathon by fall 2015.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm extremely interested in exploring the role of context awareness in the app development space, particularly with respect to using location services in conjunction with wearables' sensor readings. I'm going to include one more, ideally-articulate, sentence, with the hopes that this will put the next heading on the following line. Probably something about non-invasiveness.

			<h3>Majors</h3>
			<p>
				The NYU/Stevens Dual Degree Program is a 5-year, B.S./B.E.-yielding opportunity for students to concurrently attend both NYU in Greenwich Village and Stevens IT in Hoboken, NJ. Coursework is primarily divided into a 3-2 split, with the first 3 years focused on satisfying NYU's required coursework for a Bachelor of Science degree, and the last two years concentrating on completing Stevens' requirements for a Bachelor of Engineering degree.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Dual Degree Program allows participants to become fully immersed in the academic life of two distinct universities - with the caveat that some course scheduling conflicts will likely arise. Semesterly schedules, particularly those involving higher-level classes, often involve commuting between both campuses within the course of single day. Due to discrepencies between the universities with respect to academic calendars and class times, significant emphasis is placed on schedule planning. As a result, individual semesterly courseloads are often in excess of 18 credits to accomodate the feasiblity of completing both degrees within the 5 year span.
			</p>
			<p class="text">
				NYU's recent reacquisition of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University_Polytechnic_School_of_Engineering">Polytechnic Institute</a> at MetroTech Center normalizes the academic calendar for NYU's engineering students, while marking the end of the university's close affiliation with Stevens. Although NYU Poly will surely imbue its students with a myriad of academic opportunities, I believe participation in the Engineering Program at Stevens presents cool experiences without compare. Lots of cool resources, with emphasis on team building and project management. Make it sound like the best thing ever, with clear correlation with important software things.
			</p>
			<h3>Minors</h3>
			<p>
				At a glance, one of these things is not like the others. Hey, I did animal studies and robotics and automation. Animal Studies focused primarily on the philosophical side of things, with cool tie-ins to logic and robotics. Cool things about how the world is changing, definitions of consciousness are being challenged, and sentience is being questioned. Somehow, this magically related to things relevant to my majors. It also ties in nicely to my concentration in Robotics.
			</p>
			<h3>Extra-curriculars<img src="images/res_college.png" alt="The NYU Residential College for Leadership and Public Service" width="110px" align="right"/></h3>
			<p>

				During my time as an undergrad, I also completed a full 4-year program in NYU's Residential College for Leadership and Public Service. The Res College Program entails participation in a myriad of NYC-centric cultural, scholarly, and community service oriented events. Students are encouraged to both organize and attend events for *name drop service opportnities here.*
			</p>
			<p>
				I also did things with Play: The Games Club and played Super Smash Bros on a competitive level. This is all probably gonna get cut out.
			</p>
			
			
			<h2>Am I qualified?</h2>
			<p>
				Some links to my resume are essential. Scrub dat stuff, yo.
			</p>
			<p>
				Coursework presented in such a way that you wouldn't care to look at a resume might be nice. I'll need to check whether or not I'd just toss that on LinkedIn.
			</p>
			<p>
				Languages and things I'm comfortable in should be somewhere obvious. That might also be better left for linkedIn or the projects page.
